Hello friends!

This is my attempt to claim some space in the web.

My name is Stanley. I am a Canadian software "developer" - and I work remotely in Toronto, ON.

Currently, I am a backend software engineer at [Zapier](https://zapier.com) on the Developer Platform team. Prior to that I have worked in startups in microtransit tech - [Spare](https://spare.com), and travel tech - [CrowdRiff](https://crowdriff.com). I also interned at Amazon and IBM, which I like to mention for the street cred.

Outside of tech, I enjoy spending time with my family, finding the best consumer home products, doing endless photoshoots with my daughter and recreating my childhood favourite Chinese foods.
