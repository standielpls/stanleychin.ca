As a software developer with 8 years of professional experience, my primary focus has been on delivering impactful solutions for the companies I've worked with. While I've learned and grown tremendously throughout my career, most of my work exists within private repositories.

[Zapier](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform)'s developer platform team does maintain a public repository for the integration SDK, so there's some examples of my work that is documented publicly!
